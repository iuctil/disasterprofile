## How can I reduce the risk of disasters?
### Do you have any storm shutters installed?

Protect windows, doors and skylights with appropriate shutters or impact-resistant glass. You can nail pieces of plywood to window frames as last-minute protection.

## How can I reduce the impact of disasters?
### Do you have a planned evacuation route?

You may have to evacuate quickly due to a hurricane if you live in an evacuation zone. Learn your evacuation routes, practice with household, pets, and identify where you will stay. 

Follow the instructions from local emergency managers, who work closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies and partners. They will provide the latest recommendations based on the threat to your community and appropriate safety measures.

### Do you have non-perishable emergency supplies on hand

When a hurricane warning is issued, people run for the stores. As much as possible, get ahead of the rush having the following on hand:

* Extra batteries
* Candles or lamps with fuel
* Matches (keep these dry)
* Materials and tools for emergency home repairs–such as heavy plastic sheeting, plywood, a hammer, etc.
* Prescription drugs
* A three-day supply of drinking water
* Food that you don’t have to refrigerate or cook
* First aid supplies
* A portable NOAA weather radio
* A wrench and other basic tools
* A flashlight

### Create a home inventory

Knowing exactly what items are in your home is critical to post-storm recovery in the event that your home or belongings are damaged. It’s as simple as snapping cell phone photos of the contents in each of your home’s rooms. 

### What not to do

* Do not touch floodwaters because they may contain sewage, bacteria and chemicals that can make you ill.
* Be aware of carbon monoxide poisoning.
