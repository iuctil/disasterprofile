## How can I reduce the risk?

### Do you live in or near flood zones? 

The first defense against flooding is to know if you are in a flood zone. We recommend visiting https://floodfactor.com and understanding your flood risks. If you are in/near the flood zone, you must take this hazard extremely seriously. Please examine the rest of the vulnerabilities. The Flood zone calculation might not include a rare flooding event. You might also be affected indirectly by the flooded access road, or utility systems that are not directly next to your resident.

### Do you store sandbags/inflatable flood diversion tubes?

Sandbags or inflatable flood tubes that can be deployed quickly could lessen the impact of less severe flooding that happens more frequently.

### Does your home sit on stilts/piers?

While expensive to build retroactively, raising your house could substantially protect your home. Even an inch of floodwater could cause a significant amount of damage.

### Do your downspouts point away from your home?

If your gutter runoff is not pointed away from your house in an appropriate direction, it can pool at the corners of your house and may eventually create leaks in your basement.

## What can I do to lessen the impact of this disaster?

### Have your family conducted a flood event rehearsal recently?

Make sure your family knows what to do when flood happens. Make sure to print out all important documents (sealed in ziplock bag) and keep them in a backpack along with all items necessary during an evacuation. Keep the backpack in higher floor but easy to access location. Call your insurance agent and ask if there provide any assistance or recommendation during the flood events. https://www.ready.gov/plan

### Did you know?

Before you begin the removal of damaged items, make sure that electricity is turned off and move all electrical equipment to a dry location.
People often forget to turn off electricity before evacuating and come back home believing that electricity is off / disconnected already. Avoid electric hazard caused by floods by making sure that electricity is turned off. Do not attemp to turn off power at the breaker box if you must stand in water to do so. https://safeelectricity.org/flooding-provides-set-electrical-hazards/
