## How can I reduce the risk?

### Do you suffer from mental health issues? 

Tell someone who can help you find help immediately.
A community mental health agency
A school counselor or psychologist
A suicide prevention or crisis intervention center
A private therapist
A family physician
A religious or spiritual leader

### Are you living in a lot of stress? (job, marriage, school, relationships,finance etc.)

Don’t be afraid to reach out or ask for help. Help is available and more options for getting help exist than ever before. Reach out to at least one or more of the following

### Do you own or have access to a firearm?

Restricting access to the lethal means individuals use to attempt suicide continues to be one of the most successful strategies in preventing suicide.
Keep firearms locked in a safe and ammunition stored in a separate location.
Ask a friend or family member to store a firearm for you while you work on becoming healthy again.
Check out a local shooting club or local police precinct to see if they have temporary storage options.

### Do you have meaningful social connections? Friends, family, etc.

Social connections help us live longer, stronger, happier lives. Although some say more is better, the number of connections we have isn’t as important as how connected we feel. Strive for quality, meaningful relationships.
