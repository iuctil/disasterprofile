# About 

disasterProfile.org's goal is to inform the general public of various disaster scenarios that are likely to occur given their age, gender, and where they live. We've aggregated various data sources such as NOAA storm history, CDC common causes of death, hospital statistics, etc., and computed the general probabilities for each disaster that we believe our visitors should be aware of. 

Although each data sources, such as FEMA, NOAA, CDC, etc.. provide similar dashboard, they only focus on classes of disasters that they deal with. For example, NOAA does not provide information about common causes of death, nor CDC does not provide information about the risk of tornadoes. We believe that our visitor should be aware of all types of disasters that could impact their lives and most importantly, learn about how they can minimize the impact and what they can do to prepare for them. 

This website is developed by Indiana University Crisis Technologies Innovation Lab, and therefore we try to incorporate technological solutions that can be applied to mitigate, prepare, and recover from common disasters. 

If you have any comments/questions, or if you find this website useful, we'd like to hear from you. Please contact at [ctil@iu.edu](mailtil:ctil@iu.edu).
